# ![Microgrids.jl](https://github.com/Microgrids-X/Microgrids-artwork/raw/main/svg/Microgrids-jl.svg)

The `Microgrids.jl` package allows simulating the energetic operation of an isolated microgrid,
returning economic and operation indicators.


## Installation and testing

To install the latest released version of Microgrids.jl: `] add Microgrids`.

To install the lastest development version, follow the [instructions for unregistered packages](http://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/managing-packages/#Adding-unregistered-packages).
In particular, you can clone this repository and then, from the Julia command line,
navigate to the folder of your local copy and run:
- either `] add .` to install from the `main` branch of that local repository, but without tracking file changes
- or `] dev .` to install from that local repository *with* tracking file changes (see [dev](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/managing-packages/#developing) install)

The unit tests which ship with the package can be run with `] test Microgrids`.

## Description of Microgrids.jl

<img alt="Microgrid sizing illustration" src="https://github.com/Microgrids-X/Microgrids-artwork/raw/main/svg/microgrid_sizing.svg" width="250px">

`Microgrids.jl` can model a microgrid project consisting of:
- One load (described by a time series)
- One dispatchable generator (e.g. Diesel or hydrogen-powered)
- One energy storage (battery)
- Any number of non-dispatchable sources, typically renewable like wind or solar power,
  also modeled from time series

The energy dispatch at each instant of the simulated operation is a simple
“load following” rule-based control.
The load is power in priority from the dispatchable sources,
then the battery, and only using the dispatchable generator as a last recourse.

`Microgrids.jl` is part of the [Microgrids.X](https://github.com/Microgrids-X/) project
which provides sibling packages in other languages (e.g. in Python)
to better serve the need of different users (e.g. students).

The work on the Julia package specifically focuses on:
- **simulation speed** (about 0.2 ms to evaluate one microgrid project,
  using 1 year of load/solar/wind data at an hourly timestep), way better than pure Python (11 ms for the same task).
  See the [perf](perf) folder for simulation performance benchark.
- **differentiable model**: the exact gradient on the objective function
  (with respect to sizing parameters) can be computed using
  [ForwardDiff](http://www.juliadiff.org/ForwardDiff.jl/).

    - Thanks to our careful treatment of types (and thanks to ForwardDiff and Julia),
      computing the gradient with respect to n=3 parameters with ForwardDiff should run
      faster than with finite differences (which take n+1 = 4× simulation time)
