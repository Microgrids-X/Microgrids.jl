"""
    simulate(mg::Microgrid, smoothing::Smoothing=NoSmoothing)

Simulate the technical and economic performance of a Microgrid `mg`.

Discontinuous computations can optionally be smoothed (relaxed) using the
`Smoothing` parameters `transition` and `gain` (see their doc).
Smoothing is recommended when using gradient-based optimization.

Returns:
- Operational trajectories from `sim_operation` (should be optional in future version)
- Operational statistics from `sim_operation`
- Microgrid project costs from `sim_economics`
